For the second online interview for the coding job, you have been asked to prepare a solution
application with at least these classes:
	x	A Die class.
	x	A Game class.
		x	SevensOut class
		x	ThreeOrMore class
	x	A Statistics class
	x	A Testing class.

The rules for the two games are contained in the additional file (gameRules.txt)

x	The Die class should contain one property to hold the die current value, and one method that
	returns an integer and takes no parameters:
		int Roll()

The game should have a menu which allows players to:
	x	Instantiate the Sevens Out game
	x	Instantiate the Three Or More game
	x	View statistics data
	x	Perform tests in Testing class.

The Statistics class should:
x	Store game statistics for each game type (number of plays, high-scores, etc)

The Testing class should:
	x	Create a Game object.
	x	Use debug.assert() to verify:
		Sevens Out: Total of sum, stop if total = 7
		Three Or More: Scores set and added correctly, recognise when total >= 20.
